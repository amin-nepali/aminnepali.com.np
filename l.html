  <p><span class="question">c. In this day and age most foods are grown using chemicals. “Organic foods” are expensive, so most people can’t afford them. Taking this into consideration, suggest four ways to eat healthy food.</span><br>
  <span class="answer">It is true that organic foods are costly, but we can still eat healthy by following some simple ways. First, always wash fruits and vegetables properly before eating or cooking. Second, avoid street foods and oily snacks. Third, grow some vegetables at home if possible.

  <p><span class="question">d. “It is better to eat home-made foods at school than many of those sold in local shops.” Elaborate this statement with examples.</span><br>
  <span class="answer">Home-made food is more hygienic, nutritious, and fresh.

  <h2>Write long answers to these questions</h2>

  <p><span class="question">a. What are some healthy food? Give examples. If you were to eat the foods that you have listed, would you be healthy? Why or Why not?</span><br>
  <span class="answer">Healthy foods include fruits, green vegetables, rice, lentils, milk, meat, and eggs. These foods provide important nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, and minerals which help in the growth and maintenance of our body. Yes, if we eat these foods regularly in proper quantity, we would remain healthy because our body will get all the necessary nutrients that it needs to function properly.</span></p>

  <p><span class="question">b. List down the types of Vitamin B. Also mention their individual functions.</span><br>
  <span class="answer">There are several types of Vitamin B. Vitamin B1 helps in energy production. Vitamin B2 maintains skin and eye health. Vitamin B3 helps in digestion. Vitamin B5 helps in making hormones. Vitamin B6 helps the brain work properly. Vitamin B12 helps in making red blood cells. These B vitamins work together to keep our body strong and active by supporting important body functions.</span></p>

  <p><span class="question">c. In this day and age most foods are grown using chemicals. “Organic foods” are expensive, so most people can’t afford them. Taking this into consideration, suggest four ways to eat healthy food.</span><br>
  <span class="answer">Even if organic foods are expensive, we can still eat healthy by following four simple ways. First, always wash vegetables and fruits thoroughly before cooking or eating. Second, avoid junk food and oily snacks from outside. Third, try to buy fresh food from trusted places. Fourth, grow some vegetables and fruits at home if possible. These practices help reduce the risk of harmful chemicals and keep us healthy.</span></p>

  <p><span class="question">d. “It is better to eat home-made foods at school than many of those sold in local shops.” Elaborate this statement with examples.</span><br>
  <span class="answer">Home-made foods are safe, fresh, and nutritious, whereas most food sold in local shops may be unhealthy. For example, noodles, chips, and colored juice often sold near schools are oily, stale, or filled with preservatives. Instead, food prepared at home like rice, vegetables, roti, boiled eggs, or fruits is prepared in a clean environment and has more nutrients. So, eating home-made food is always the better and safer option for school students.</span></p>

  <p><span class="question">e. Food adulteration is a big problem nowadays. Mention a couple of real examples of food adulteration. How is this a problem for us? Give any two reasons.</span><br>
  <span class="answer">Food adulteration means mixing harmful or unwanted substances in food to increase quantity or profit. Some examples are mixing water in milk and adding soap in ghee. These practices are harmful to health. First, they reduce the quality of food. Second, they may cause serious diseases such as stomach problems, poisoning, or even cancer. Therefore, food adulteration is a major threat to our health and needs to be stopped.</span></p>
